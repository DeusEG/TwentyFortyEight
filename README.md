# Game 2048

_in progress..._
 
Curently implemented:
- package structure
- class architecture
- collections
- generics
- exception

Problems:
- when we cant move a new element is added  
- when an element reaches 128 points it stops combining  
- loss is checked by empty cells, and not by the possibility of a move
